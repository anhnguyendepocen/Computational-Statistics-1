# Computational Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains different materials regarding computational statistics:

- [ComputationalStatistics-master.zip](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/ComputationalStatistics-master.zip) - this a repo copy owned by [Brian Spiering](https://github.com/brianspiering/ComputationalStatistics). Brian's talk during [DSCO19]() in San Francisco was a trigger for me to start dealing more systhematically with computational statistics.
- [analytical_vs_computational.pdf](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/analytical_vs_computational.pdf) - a few slides with a context and brief summary of analytical and computational methods.
