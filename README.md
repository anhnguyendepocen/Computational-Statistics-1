# Computational Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains different materials regarding computational statistics:

- [ComputationalStatistics-master.zip](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/ComputationalStatistics-master.zip) - this a repo copy owned by [Brian Spiering](https://github.com/brianspiering/ComputationalStatistics). Brian's talk during [DSCO19]() in San Francisco was a trigger for me to start dealing more systhematically with computational statistics.
- [analytical\_vs\_computational.pdf](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/analytical_vs_computational.pdf) - a few slides with a context and brief summary of analytical and computational methods.
- Analytical vs. Computational Methods - **Example 1: Simulating Outcomes** ([Jupyter](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Example1.ipynb), [HTML](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/ComputationalStatisticsExample1.html))
- Analytical vs. Computational Methods - **Example 2: Permutation Testing** ([Jupyter](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Example2.ipynb), [HTML](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/ComputationalStatisticsExample2.html))
